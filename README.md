# Portfolio-projects

Population in smart cities is growing, as well as Climate-related challenges. Smart cities are seen to become the "test" new urban environment to tackle with these challenges with the help of digitalisation and big data analysis.  In this 1st part of my project I am focusing on the smart cities vs urban population issue to inentify key macro patterns.  List of smart cities mentioned in the IMD Smart City Index Ranking.

In my project devided in three parts I am exploring Smart Cities at macro level from different angles: in terms of growing population and climate-related challenges, as well as its external assessment.

In this 2nd part of my project I am focusing on the Smart Cities Index dataset to inentify if the total Smart City Index has any of subindexes (areas of assesment and living) that contribute more to its value. The key goal is to identify priority areas for smart cities development.


Here all my code is uploaded. Links to the publicly available datasets provided inside the notebooks.

Thank you for your comments and suggestions.

Sincerely,
Luca
