Same is true for the widely-discussed recently concept of smart cities (SC). These cities of the future are seen to become the new sustainable urban environment to tackle with all the current challenges with the help of digitalisation, as well as big data analysis.\n\n* The Main goal of the project: to identify trends and convert insights from smart cities' and global data into smart cities' business opportinities. \n* In this part of my project, I am focusing on the smart cities vs urban population issue to inentify key macro patterns in urbanization to understand if there are any patterns in urbanisation of smart cities itself.\n\n[Check out the 1st part of this project here.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/olgashevtsova/1-smart-cities-visualizing-sci-with-python) \n\n[Check out the part 3 of the project here.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/olgashevtsova/3-energy-the-world-and-the-city)\n\n**Key finding:** \n* Population of smart cities represents in average 13% and up to 20% of urban population per country. \n* Smart Cities' population is the target audience for the developers of new local Smart services.\n* All pressing issues related to the overall urbanization can become even more intence for those cities, so development of smart suburbs can be another point of interest. \n\n**Tools:**\n* Google Big Query: SQL data cleaning and exploration\n* MS Excel: final review and cleaning of missing values\n\nList of smart cities: those mentioned in the IMD Smart City Index ranking list.\n\n### Datasets Sources:\n\n1. **IMD Smart Cities Index 2020**\n    Institute for Management Development (IMD) published their Smart City Index 2020 and 2019 report, ranking cities worldwide according to their “smartness” levels. \n    Available at: https://blog.threeandahalfroses.com/2020/11/30/the-imd-smart-city-index-2020-report-with-excel-download/\n    \n2. **Population, total** \n    ID: SP.POP.TOTL\n    License:  CC BY-4.0 \n    Aggregation Method: Sum\n    Available at: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL\n    \n3. **Population, urban (% of total population)**\n    ID: SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS\n    Source: United Nations Population Division.
